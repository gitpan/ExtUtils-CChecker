        [CHANGES]
         * Add a 'quiet' option so EU:CB's quiet can be disabled (RT91363)
         * Fixed some typoes in docs

0.08    CHANGES:
         * Include PID in test file names to guard against collisions when
           building concurrently (RT76013)

0.07    CHANGES:
         * Use Test::Fatal instead of Test::Exception
         * Advise against calling it "config.h" as that gets confused with
           core perl's file

0.06    CHANGES:
         * Added 'defines_to' constructor arg for writing a "config.h" file
           instead of -DFOO on compiler commandline

0.05    CHANGES:
         * Added accessors for callers to push more library dirs or compiler
           or linker flags

        BUGFIXES:
         * Ensure that ->new_module_build merges its args and internal
           configuration correctly

0.04    CHANGES:
         * Provide optional variants of ->find_include_dirs_for and
           ->find_libs_for with try_... prefix

0.03    CHANGES:
         * Support defining compiler symbols based on successful test runs,
           so XS code can be conditional on it
         * Line-terminate test C code to avoid (harmless) warnings from some
           C compilers

0.02    CHANGES:
         * Support automatic construction of a preconfigured Module::Build
         * Also implement extra_compiler_flags for completeness
